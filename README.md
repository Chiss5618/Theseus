<h1 align="center">Theseus (Balanced)</h1>

This mod adds Theseus, a custom Hero tower that excels at boss events with his array of laser weapons.

This version of the Theseus contains improved balancing with reduced cash generation, lower damage and pierce, and slower hero leveling. Overall, while Theseus still has good offensive power, especially with his abilities, he acts more like a support tower at lower levels by weakening bloons and generating cash.

Notable Changes:
Price 975 => 1250
Base Pierce 4 => 2
Base Damage 2 => 1
Base Cash Generation 2 => 1.75
Lvl 9 Cash Generation 4 => 2.625
Project Archimedes Normal Boss Damage 7 million => 1.5 million
Project Archimedes Elite Boss Damage 7 million => 4.5 million

Overall, Theseus is still kinda OP, but less so
